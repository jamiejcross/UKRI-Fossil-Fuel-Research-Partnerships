Our current decentralized wastewater treatment model needs replacing with those that generate energy from waste and recover resources such as nutrients. Wastewater treatment alone accounts for up to 1.0% of total UK and 1.3% of US electricity. It is both capitally and

In 2018, 18% of the UK population were aged 65 and over. This is expected to reach 23% (approximately 16 million) by 2035. South Korea has one of the most aged populations in Asia with the number of people aged 65 or older expected to reach 15 million, accounting for 30% of the population in 2035. The combinat"

To do this we need to determine the processes which moderate the fluid-mineral reaction kinetics, particularly the nature of the processes which result in much more sluggish kinetics in field settings c"
